def printAll(seq, level=0):
    print(f"Level {level}: {seq}")
    if seq:
        print(seq[0])
        printAll(seq[1:], level+1)

seq = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
printAll(seq)



The printAll function works as expected,
because it prints each element on a new line,
and stops when the sequence becomes empty.


There is a hidden cost in running this function,
due to the fact that it is a recursive function.
A lot of memory is required for this function for
the creation of new stack frames.
